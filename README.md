# Dev mentions

I used **react-native:0.64.2** from [this remote repo](https://central.sonatype.dev/artifact/com.beatjs.android/react-native/0.64.2.0).

In (app level) build.gradle added this line below:

`
    implementation 'com.beatjs.android:react-native:0.64.2.0'
`

And for custom react-native SDK:

`
    implementation files("libs/app-release.aar")
`
